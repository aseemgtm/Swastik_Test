# Swastik_Test
This project is a django, python based webapp.
The frontend couldn't be implemented on time
so i have followed a different approach 
where every Employee and Manager is able to login
on the admin page and based on the permissions 
they are granted they can make changes to the product and projects.

Projects are tasks related to building and maintaining a Product.
